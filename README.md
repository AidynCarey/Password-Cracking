# Password-Cracking

Objective
This is a two part assignment. In the first part, you'll conduct a password audit using John the Ripper on a set of password hashes.  In the second part, you will create password policies for two groups. Below you will find an example policy you can use as reference and help with your own research. You can and should also use the textbook, the Internet and, most importantly, your own cleverness to create these policies. If you find any good information that you want to use as reference, use your understanding in your own words with a citation for the source. Wikipedia can be a useful spring board to legitimate sources, but Wikipedia itself is not a credible source.

 

The assignment is not meant to demonstrate only your password cracking ability, but to demonstrate that you know how to run a password audit and recognizing the importance of good passwords and policies.

Deliverables
 

The deliverables for this assignment will be split into 2 parts: results of the Password Audit and the creation of password policies. The password audit will be due first so that you can take into account those results as you craft the new policies.

 

Password Audit Deliverables:
 

1. Minimum half page letter to Mr. Avenal that explains what you were requested to do, what you did, and what you found.

 

Note that Avenal is paying you and so your letter should be written in business style with little-to-no technical terminology

2. A table that includes the usernames and for each, Method used to break the account (If dictionary, include the dictionary used ), and Why the password was broken (Too short, Used in a dictionary, etc) See example table below

 

3. The URL or location of the additional dictionary file/wordlist used

 

4. Your john.log file. This file is located in a hidden .john directory off your user's home directory. Full path: ~/.john/john.log . I want the full file, not a screenshot or a copy/paste text, but the actual file submitted. Without this file, you will not receive credit for password audit portion of the assignment.
